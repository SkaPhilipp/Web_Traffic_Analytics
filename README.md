# Web_traffic_analytics 

This is a toy project to generate synthetic datasets that simulate user traffic on a website and to compare different approaches to analyse the traffic.

Once the synthetic data is generated we will test different ways to analyse the website traffic and measure which approach scales better with respect to website size and number of users accessing the website.
